Hello, devlopers
I developed a video upload web where customers can register and watch videos of yoga coaches and pilates coaches during the non-face-to-face period. 
This is a prototype version. You can decorate by adding your own web design.

I hope you have a good design.

To use this application, 

1. make dev.js file inside config folder 
2. put mongoDB info into dev.js file 
3. Type  " npm install " inside the root directory  ( Download Server Dependencies ) 
4. Type " npm install " inside the client directory ( Download Front-end Dependencies )


Thank you for having interest in this repository !
